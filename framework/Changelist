Here is a list of the major changes, for details, please see ABDoc.pdf under the ./doc folder. The server/client protocols remains unchanged, so the old version agents can still work with the server.

================ Changes Since abV1.32 ====================================
1. Plugin fix for the zooming functions. The zoom in and zoom out functions stopped working because Google Chrome has changed the api of WheelEvent (since chrome version 38.0.2125.104).
 
2. Change the software license to the GNU Affero General Public License
 
================ Changes Since abV1.31 ====================================
1. The RealShape segmentation can now distinguish between hollow and solid objects (see ABDoc.pdf section Object Representation)

2. Better triangle recognition: Triangles are treated as Polygon.java while the previous version often mis-detects the triangles as circle. 

3. Add findHills() in Vision.java (in the previous version, the hill is returned by the method findBlocksRealShape()) 

4. Add findTNTs() in Vision.java (in the previous version, you need to call VisionMBR.findTNTs() to get all the TNTs) 

5. In Rect.java, the attributes PreciseWidth and PreciseHeight are changed to plength and pwidth, respectively. The corresponding methods are also changed accordingly.

6. The method estimateLaunchPoint (see /src/ab/planner/TrajectoryPlanner.java) now returns empty list of release points when no plausible trajectories found for that target, and in this case, the sample agent will make a 45 degree shot.
7. The isReachable method (see /src/ab/utils/ABUtil) now returns true (reachable) when a trajectory can reach the target without obstruction. Previously, the method only checks the obstruction by assuming the input trajectory always passes the target.  

5. Bug Fixes:
5.1 Fix the bug that the method findBirdsRealShape() always returns unknown birds. 
5.2 Fix the bug in build.xml where the main-class was set to "ClientNaiveAgent.java" (should be "MainEntry.java")  
5.3 Fix the bug that the method findBlocksRealShape() returns Pigs. (Now the method returns Wood, Stone, and Ice)

================ Changes Since abV1.30 =====================================
1. New Vision Module (see Package ./src/ab/vision):
The new vision module is composed of two image segmentation components. One component segments an image and outputs a list of the minimum bounding rectangles (MBR) of essential objects in the image. The essential objects includes {‚ÄúSling‚Ä? "Red Bird‚Ä? ‚ÄúYellow Bird‚Ä? ‚ÄúBlue Bird‚Ä? ‚ÄúBlack Bird‚Ä? ‚ÄúWhite Bird‚Ä? "Pig", "Ice", ‚ÄúWood", "Stone", "TNT‚Ä? ‚ÄúTrajPoints‚Äù}. The other component outputs real shapes instead.  You can use either of them to process a screenshot.

2. Useful methods:
2.1 Get the type of the bird on the sling (see File ./src/ab/demo/other/ActionRobot.java).
2.2 Get all the supports of an object (see File ./src/ab/utils/ABUtil.java).
2.3 Test whether a point is reachable by a trajectory (see File ./src/ab/utils/ABUtil.java).


4. Code re-factoring and bug fixes.
